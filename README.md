# Share-Safe Music
Co-developed by Liskomato and 0KepOnline. Adds 209 new audio tracks from Spore and Galactic Adventures to be selectable as act background music in the Adventure Editor. All of the music tracks found in this mod should work in adventures without the mod installed.

CAUTION: Some of the audio tracks included with the mod will not loop. Be aware of that.

## How does this work? (Technical explanation)
This mod is, in practice, the same as any other music mod made for Spore: Galactic Adventures. However, what makes this mod special is that instead of adding completely new music tracks into the game, the mod instead references existing audio tracks already found in-game, which means that even if you uninstall the mod, the adventure will still reference those audio tracks that are already found in-game, and plays them without knowing better.

HOWEVER, this doesn't extend into the nodes placed into the editor, as is usually added with music mods. If you try to play adventures that have these music tracks placed into a planet with a node (Note: NOT as act music!), they will get replaced if you don't have the package including those nodes installed. However, if there is demand for it, a version of the mod can be made which includes placeable node versions of the music tracks found in this mod. The intent here being if you really wanted to and don't particularly care about sharability at that moment.
